The generation of AppImage is performed in a Docker container.
For that purpose two Docker images are used: A base image where all dependencies
are installed and another one where RTNeuron is built. You don't have to build the base
image as it is available at Docker Hub as bluebrain/rtneuron_builder
(you can jump directly to point 2).

The step-by-step instructions for generating the RTNeuron AppImage follow:

1. Build the base image (optional):
   - cd packaging/AppImage/builder
   - docker build -t bluebrain/rtneuron_builder .
2. cd ../../.. (the root of RTNeuron git repository)
3. Build a docker image with command below:
   - docker build  -f DockerfileAppImage  -t app_image_builder .
3. Start the container mounting the volume where the AppImage  will be copied
   (e.g. current working directory):
   - docker run -ti --rm -v $(pwd):/tmp/output app_image_builder
   The AppImage is copied into current path as rtneuron_x86_64.AppImage
